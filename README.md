# Projects

In this github are presented all my university projects. For now there are only the pdfs, in future I will add also the python code correlated.

##Polarization of opinions on social networks
Abstract:
Social Network have become an omnipresent means for the discussion of moral and political issues. It is believed that they have significantly contributed to altering the course of numerous historical events such as the Arab Spring and the United States presidential elections. Based on a sufficiently large sample of interactions on Twitter regarding traditionally polarizing issues in U.S. politics (such as same-sex marriage, gun control, and climate change), we introduce a mathematical model for opinion polarization in Social Networks. We then provide an analytical definition of polarization, leveraging the concept of communities in a graph and employing gradient descent technique. We compare the numerical results with empirical ones to identify the model parameters that best represent the available data. Finally, we develop various machine learning models using the data at our disposal.

##Vatican project: Pal lat 1071, Lat Urb 1
Abstract:
Image detection is a key element for different field. It is useful for both everyday life and for different scientific fields. The study of images within an ancient book can be really worthwhile for linguists and art experts, in fact it can help date and identify the provenance of the book.
In this experience we use two optimized segmentation algorithm to count and identify the decoration inside Pal. Lat. 1071 and Lat. Urb. 1 in order to achieve a better understanding of its application and to understand the main image detection issue.

##Polish power system analysis
Abstract:
Energy is a key element for the development of any nation. During the last decades power consumption has increased exponentially all over the world, also increasing awareness over global warning and climate change. To make sure that everyone in the world has access to clean and safe energy, we need to understand the energy consumption patterns and be able to predict the increasing demand and its impact around the world, today, in the future and in the past.
In this report we will exploit the different well-established techniques for time series analysis in order to compare the different results and achieve a better understanding of their application. Moreover, we will train a simple variant of the well-known ARIMA model for time series forecasting and an artificial neural network to make an approximated prediction of the upcoming power consumptions.

##47 Tucanae Globular Cluster Analysis
Abstract:
We present a new study of the 47 Tucanae Globular Cluster imaged during Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle 17 for 121 orbits using the Wide Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys. During this analysis we tested different approaches in order to realise a complete catalog of the stars in 47 Tucanae Globular Cluster and the superimposed Small Magellanic Cloud. The main goal of the lab experience was to try different techniques for photometry and implement novel software to a well-established field such as astrometry.

##Correlation between High Fluctuations in Temperature and Mortality for Various Classes of Ages in  Rome
Abstract:
Climate change is one of the most important topics in our society and it is also important to understand its impact on our lives. In this study, I examine the correlation between high fluctuations in temperature and mortality for different classes of ages in Rome. I have used two different data sets: the first, which refers to mortality for different classes of ages (≤ 64, 65 − 74, 75 − 84 and ≥ 85 years); and the second, which refers to the mean temperature, and I study the period from January 1st 2011 to December 31st 2019, with a sampling period of 1 day. I found a linear correlation between temperature and mortality for all age groups with lags of 0, 3, 4 and 5 days. Both hot and cold temperatures are correlated with mortality, and I found that February, March and April are the periods usually more correlated.
